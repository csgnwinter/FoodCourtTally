# FoodCourtTally

Hungry but when you reached the food court it was full? Or worried about catching Covid-19 due to the high number of people in the food court? Thatâ€™s what our team hopes to solve. We are implementing an application that keeps track of the available seats at a food court and displays it on a web site for people to check and make accurate decisions from there.
